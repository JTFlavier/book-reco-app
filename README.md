# Introduction

This is a simple website I made using React.js, the purpose of which is to mock up a web app in under an hour which will recommend a selection of books given 5 books.

The example books given is this:

Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson
The Food Lab by J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt
The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book by Bill Watterson
Harpo Speaks by Harpo Marx
Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins

What I did was to mock up a basic React.js app that takes in 5 inputs, then output a list of recommended books.

I used https://www.readgeek.com free trial to create a sample output of recommended books. This was done due to time constraints since I would not be able to find a trained model or an API to use for this exercise.
